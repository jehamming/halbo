/**
 * Camera manages a first person camera in 3D space. It calculates the necessary
 * matrix transformations to orient the camera, and provides a simplified
 * mechanism for orienting the camera via movement and rotation methods. It makes
 * heavy use of the Vector class.
 * <p>
 * Camera is meant to be used with OpenGL, which uses a right-handed system.
 * Camera, however, creates a transparent layer between this and functions as
 * if it was using a left-handed coordinate system (into the screen being
 * positive Z rather than negative). ViewState uses a left-handed system in the
 * sense that objects only exist in positive coordinates extending forward, up
 * and right from the origin. This is by virtue of the fact that coordinates of
 * objects (which are integers) are simply stored as indices in a 3D array.
 * Because Camera's methods cater to the state's system, Camera is a part of the
 * model (MVC), not the view. This decision was made through the logic that
 * Camera represents a property of the Player (its view) rather than an aspect
 * of rendering. Internally, however, Camera is more of a mix of the model and
 * the view.
